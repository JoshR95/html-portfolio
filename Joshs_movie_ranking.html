<H3>Lord of the rings</H3>

<p>
Amazing movie about adventure, fantasy and action. a MUST watch.
</p>

<H3>Troy</H3>

<p>
One of my favourite films set in ancient Greece that is based around the seige of Troy.
A fantastic film staring Orlando Bloom and Brad Pitt, with very good actions scense throughout.

<H3>Hercules</H3>

<p>
For me this arguably the best disney film ever produced. I am quite biased towards ancient Greece
which makes this more enjoyable for me. However this film is sprinkled with great action, humour 
and superb stroy telling
